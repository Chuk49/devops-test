# Guidelines & Expectations
This assessment is intended as a conversation starter to better understand your approach and way
of working.
Here are some helpful guidelines:
- Time limit: Aim to spend no more than two hours. Prioritize quality over quantity.
- Completeness: A fully working solution isn’t necessary, but providing something
runnable is appreciated.
- Quality first: Show us your best work in the areas that matter most to you.•
- Questions welcome: Feel free to reach out anytime if you need clarification or assistance.
- And importantly—have fun with the assignment!
# Goal:
Create a small web site that displays "Hello" on the first visit, and "World" on any subsequent
visits.
# Requirements
## Functionality
- When a user opens the webpage for the first time, it should show a page with just the
word: Hello
- When the user refreshes or returns later, it should instead show: World
## Tech Stack
• Free choice but source code should be kept on a GitHub/GitLab type solution.
## Documentation
• Include instructions on how deploy it so we can deploy it and test the documentation.
On the onsite interview will review the code and ask questions. We’re not just looking at your
final result—we’re equally interested in understanding the decisions, trade-offs, and shortcuts
you’ve chosen along the way.

# Approach
I simply went for the simples solution I can think of.
